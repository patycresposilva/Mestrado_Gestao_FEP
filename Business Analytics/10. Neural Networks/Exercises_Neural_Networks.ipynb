Neural networks can have multiple hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each hidden layer can vary depending on the complexity of the problem being solved => transform (mathematically) the values of the predictors; we can have several hidden layers and each one of them can have as many neurons as we want (we can choose the number of hidden layers and also the number of neurons in each layer) => they will be a hyperparameter\n",
